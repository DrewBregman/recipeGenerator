# RecipeGenerator

## Description
This project uses Elixir, PostgreSQL, Phoenix LiveView, and React Javascript to web-scrape near 10,000 recipes from www.gordanramsay.com, www.jamieolivier.com, and www.allrecipes.com. You can randomly generate one recipe at a time, add filters (fitler by chef, food type, meal type, and geography), and receive a great recipe with instructions and directions. Happy cooking.
